# GitCash.io Support Request and Feature Discussion Repo
This repo is a place to ask for help with the GitCash.io Github Tipping Bot.  It's also the appropriate place to propose new features you'd like to see in GitCash.

### Asking for help or reporting an Issue
Just create a new issue from the issues tab and describe what's going on.  We will label it appropriately then get back to you as soon as we can.


### Feature Discussion
DO you have a good idea for making GitCash more useful or fun?  Just make a new issue from the issues tab.  We'll mark it as a "feature request" then we will all use the comment section to discussing it.  If it's feasable, we will put it on our roadmap.
